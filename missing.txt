## Missing Cases

Asthetics > aes_group_order: example 10 -11: (polyplot image is not available in the ggplot2 directory)
Asthetics > aes_group_order: example 13 -14 duplicates: (i dont see any duplicates either in my local or github. Could be your local's issue)
aes_linetype_size_shape: example 12: (polyplot image is not available in the ggplot2 directory)
Scales > lims : example 1,2,3,7: (polyplot image is not available in the ggplot2 directory)
